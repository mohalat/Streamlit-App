In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer retention is critical to maintaining revenue and profitability. Customer churn, where subscribers discontinue their service, directly impacts a company's bottom line. The objective of the project is to develop an interactive platform called streamlit that identifies which customers are at risk of churning. By understanding the factors that drive churn, telecom companies can take proactive measures to reduce churn, optimize customer experience, and improve long-term customer loyalty. A Streamlit App for predicting telco customer churn is an interactive tool designed to help telecom companies identify customers at risk of leaving their services. The app allows users to upload customer data, visualize trends, and analyze key factors contributing to churn. By leveraging machine learning models, the app provides real-time churn predictions and actionable insights, enabling businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
